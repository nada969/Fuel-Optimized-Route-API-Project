# Fuel-Optimized-Route-API-Project

A Django REST API that:
  - Accepts a start and finish location (within USA).
  - Retrieves the route geometry.
  - Calculates optimal fuel stops based on lowest fuel prices.

Returns:
- Route map data (JSON)
- Fuel stop locations
- Total fuel cost for the trip

Features
- Route calculation using free routing API (OpenRouteService or Geoapify)
- Fuel optimization based on price data
- Multiple fuel stops if route exceeds 500 miles
